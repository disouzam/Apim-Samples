# Samples: APIM Costing & Showback

This sample demonstrates how to track and allocate API costs using Azure API Management with Azure Monitor, Application Insights, Log Analytics, and Cost Management. It supports three complementary approaches: **subscription-based** tracking (using APIM subscription keys), **Entra ID application** tracking (using the `emit-metric` policy with JWT `appid` claims), and **AI Gateway token/PTU** tracking (using the `emit-metric` policy to capture per-client token consumption when APIM acts as an AI Gateway). All approaches share a single Azure Monitor Workbook with tabbed views.

⚙️ **Supported infrastructures**: All infrastructures (or bring your own existing APIM deployment)

👟 **Expected *Run All* runtime (excl. infrastructure prerequisite): ~15 minutes**

## 🎯 Objectives

1. **Track API usage by caller** - Use APIM subscription keys to identify business units, departments, or applications
2. **Track API usage by Entra ID application** - Use the `emit-metric` policy to extract `appid`/`azp` JWT claims and emit per-caller custom metrics
3. **Capture request metrics** - Log subscriptionId, apiName, operationName, and status codes
4. **Aggregate cost data** - Combine API usage metrics with Azure Cost Management data
5. **Visualize showback data** - Create Azure Monitor Workbooks with tabbed views for both approaches
6. **Enable cost governance** - Establish patterns for consistent tagging and naming conventions
7. **Enable budget alerts** - Create scheduled query alerts when callers exceed configurable thresholds
8. **Track AI token consumption per client** - When APIM is used as an AI Gateway, capture prompt, completion, and total token usage per calling application, enabling per-client cost attribution for PTU or pay-as-you-go OpenAI deployments

## ✅ Prerequisites

Beyond the [general prerequisites](../../README.md#-getting-started) (Azure subscription, CLI, Python environment), this sample requires additional Azure RBAC role assignments.

### Azure RBAC Permissions

The signed-in user needs the following role assignments:

| Role                              | Scope           | Purpose                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Contributor**                   | Resource Group  | Deploy Bicep resources (App Insights, Log Analytics, Storage, Workbook, Diagnostic Settings) |
| **Cost Management Contributor**   | Subscription    | Create Cost Management export                                                                |
| **Storage Blob Data Contributor** | Storage Account | Write cost export data (auto-assigned by the notebook)                                       |

### For Workbook Consumers

Users who only need to **view** the deployed Azure Monitor Workbook (not deploy the sample) need:

| Role                     | Scope                   | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Monitoring Reader**    | Resource Group          | Open and view the workbook                        |
| **Log Analytics Reader** | Log Analytics Workspace | Execute the Kusto queries that power the workbook |

> 💡 If a user can open the workbook but sees empty visualizations, they are likely missing **Log Analytics Reader** on the workspace.

## 📝 Scenario

Organizations often need to allocate the cost of shared API Management infrastructure to different consumers (business units, departments, applications, or customers). This sample addresses:

- **Cost Transparency**: Understanding which teams or applications drive API consumption
- **Chargeback/Showback**: Producing data that can inform internal billing or cost awareness
- **Resource Optimization**: Identifying high-cost consumers and opportunities for optimization
- **Budget Planning**: Historical usage patterns to forecast future costs

### Key Principle: Cost Determination, Not Billing

This sample focuses on **producing cost data**, not implementing billing processes. You determine costs; how you use that information (showback reports, chargeback, budgeting) is a separate business decision.

### Three Tracking Approaches

| Aspect                     | Subscription-Based                           | Entra ID Application                                 | AI Gateway Token/PTU                                       |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Caller identification**  | APIM subscription key (`ApimSubscriptionId`) | JWT `appid`/`azp` claim                              | JWT `appid`/`azp` claim                                    |
| **Data source**            | `ApiManagementGatewayLogs` in Log Analytics  | `customMetrics` in Application Insights              | `customMetrics` in Application Insights                    |
| **Tracking mechanism**     | Built-in APIM logging                        | `emit-metric` policy                                 | `emit-metric` policy (outbound response parsing)           |
| **Metric name**            | N/A (built-in logs)                          | `caller-requests`                                    | `caller-tokens`                                            |
| **Cost Management export** | Yes (storage account)                        | No (metrics-based)                                   | No (metrics-based)                                         |
| **Best for**               | Dedicated subscriptions per BU               | OAuth client-credentials flows, shared subscriptions | AI Gateway scenarios (Azure OpenAI, PTU capacity planning) |

All three approaches are deployed together. Toggle `enable_entraid_tracking` and `enable_token_tracking` in the notebook to include or exclude each flow.

- **SKU-Based Pricing** - Automatically derives base monthly cost, overage rate, and included request allowance from the deployed APIM SKU using built-in pricing data (sourced from the [Azure API Management pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/api-management/), March 2026)
- **Budget Alerts** (optional) - Per-BU scheduled query alerts when request thresholds are exceeded

### Cost Allocation Model

| Component           | Formula                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base Cost Share** | `Base Monthly Cost x (BU Requests / Total Requests)` |
| **Variable Cost**   | `BU Requests x (Rate per 1K / 1000)`                 |
| **Total Allocated** | `Base Cost Share + Variable Cost`                    |

### What Gets Logged

| Field                | Description                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `ApimSubscriptionId` | Identifies the caller (BU / department / app) |
| `ApiId`              | Which API was called                          |
| `OperationId`        | Specific operation within the API             |
| `ResponseCode`       | Success / failure indication                  |
| Request count        | Number of requests (primary cost metric)      |

> **Important**: The API must have `subscriptionRequired: true` for `ApimSubscriptionId` to be populated in logs. This sample configures it automatically.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Decide which of the [Infrastructure Architectures][infrastructure-architectures] you wish to use.
    1. If the infrastructure *does not* yet exist, navigate to the desired [infrastructure][infrastructure-folder] folder and follow its README.md.
    1. If the infrastructure *does* exist, adjust the `user-defined parameters` in the *Initialize notebook variables* below. Please ensure that all parameters match your infrastructure.
2. Run All Cells.

## 🖼️ Expected Results

After running the notebook, you will have:

1. **Application Insights** showing real-time API requests and `caller-requests` custom metrics (Entra ID)
2. **Log Analytics** with queryable `ApiManagementGatewayLogs` (resource-specific table)
3. **Storage Account** receiving cost export data
4. **Azure Monitor Workbook** with tabbed views for both subscription-based and Entra ID cost allocation
5. **Portal links** printed in the notebook's final cell for quick access
